    <div class="text"> <h2>The Project UGANDA is a pursuit to get students to give their overall health and welfare a lot of thought, as well as their ability to learn about and participate in urban gardening. This project intends to expose other schools' eyes to the benefits of having their pupils participate in urban gardening activities.

As one of the main advantages of this project, which are the crops and fruits from planting, will be essential not only for the school canteen but also for the students who are pursuing studies in the academic track of Home Economics or Cookery in the strand TVL (Technical Vocational and Livelihood), as they will have easy access to their most basic needs for cooking, which is required for their chosen track.

    <div class="text"><h1> Drying seeds before planting prepares the seed in such a way that helps it protect the insides so that the seed germinates and produces a healthy seedling.

Seeds, when dried before planting stand a better chance of germination as the drying process hardens and seals the protective coat around inner parts.
<br></br>
The benefits of drying seeds include:

<li>‚ù•The seeds become easy to germinate</li>
<li>‚ù•Ease of planting</li>
<li>‚ù•There will be minimal risk of infestation and contamination</li>
<li>‚ù•Free from damage and rot</li>
<li>‚ù•Free from pesticides and diseases that attack wet seeds. </div></li></h1>

    <div class="text"><h3><b>To reuse/recycle rainwater without increasing mosquito populations:</b>

<ul>1. Use covered containers with tight-fitting lids to store rainwater.</ul>
<ul>2. Inspect and maintain containers to prevent mosquito entry.</ul>
<ul>3. Add mosquito dunks or larvicides to kill mosquito larvae.</ul>
<ul>4. Install overflow prevention mechanisms to divert excess water.</ul>
<ul>5. Regularly empty and clean containers to remove mosquito eggs/larvae.</ul>
<ul>6. Use the water frequently to minimize stagnant water.</ul>
<ul>7. Consider rain gardens or soakaways to allow water infiltration.</ul>
<ul>8. Eliminate standing water sources around your property.</ul>
 
By following these steps, you can safely reuse/recycle rainwater while preventing mosquito breeding.</h3>

	discipline and mastery necessary to do so, but also on enabling each student to have access to nutritious foods without being constrained by fluctuations in the price of t
	hose foods on the market. Additionally, the Lagro High School Cookery students will benefit from this project due to their significant involvement. Furthermore, this is an awa
	reness-raising and proactive move to persuade other schools to start their own Project UGANDA. We demonstrate the advantages of this and why it is required for it to be a gener
	ational phenomenon, making this possible and effective.</h2>

    <div class="text"><h3>There are several ways to make natural fertilizer at home. Here are a few methods:

<li>1. Composting: Collect organic waste such as food scraps, grass clippings, and fallen leaves and place them in a compost bin or pile.
 Over time, the organic matter will decompose and turn into nutrient-rich compost that can be used as fertilizer.</li>

<li>2. Manure composting: Collect animal manure (from herbivores only), mix it with organic materials such as straw or sawdust,
 and let it compost for several months before using it as fertilizer.</li>

<li>3. Epsom salt fertilizer: Mix one tablespoon of Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) with one gallon of water and use it to water plants once a month.
 Epsom salt can help with plant growth and flowering.</li>

<li>4. Banana peel fertilizer: Collect banana peels and place them in a jar with water. Let the peels sit in the water for a few days and then pour the banana water over your plants.
 Banana peels contain potassium, phosphorus, and calcium which can help with plant growth.</li>

<li>Remember, natural fertilizers may take longer to work and may not provide instant results like synthetic fertilizers do. However, they are better for the environment and can
 improve the overall health of your soil and plants over time.</li>

    <div class="text"><h2>This project seeks to implement new planting techniques while imparting planting knowledge to all participants without demanding for financial assistance.
	To complete our demands for the items specified below, however, this project needs a bigger helping hand. This budget proposal breaks down the project's costs item by item, 
	with justifications for each cost component. Community gardens are a great approach to promote unity among communities. Working together to allocate responsibilities, upfront costs, and the fruits of labor can help you understand and appreciate your neighbors in ways you never imagined. Many people enjoy gardening as a hobby, and there are many different types of gardens to try. Indoor gardening, also known as container gardening, can be done in a small space and on a small budget.
	Gardening is a healthy and adaptable hobby, and we need that connection for our minds and bodies as people.
